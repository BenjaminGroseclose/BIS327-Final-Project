                    As the playoffs kick off, the league is full of excitement. While every team is hopefull for a championship
                    there are a limited number of teams that are actually in contention. For example, Houston and Golden State are 
                    clear front runners for the Western Conference bid. While on the East side, it is hard to bet against Lebron
                    however, his team around him is shaky at best. Toronto seems to be more of a favorite, but only time will tell 
                    what happens between Cleveland, Toronto. Additionally people seem to think the 76ers are going to make some noise
                    I tend to believe that they will fall victim in the second round. Given that they survive the Heat.
