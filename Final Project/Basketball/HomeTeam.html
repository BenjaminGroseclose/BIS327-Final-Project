                        How does a boy from Michigan fall in love with the Utah Jazz simple, quality basketball and Ricky Rubio. 
                        A few years back basketball peaked my interest, I had played basetkball and didn't really know  many NBA 
                        players. What I did know though was how I played basketball. Too be frank about it, I couldn't shoot to save 
                        my life, but I loved to get assits and play defense. So after examining much of the league I quickly found 
                        that Ricky Rubio while so much better than me at everything fill those categories on the NBA level. 
                        Thus began my love for Ricky Rubio. Without a doubt though he was hard to route for. He currently is in his
                        seventh year as a NBA player and until this year he has really struggle on the offensive end. Though he 
                        still had quality assist number he shooting never progressed. This year has changed though. While his assist 
                        numbers are drastically down, he is shooting much better on all levels with more attempts and has started to
                        remove the "Worst Shooter in Modern History" title he had claimed. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Quality Basketball
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        But this isn't about Ricky Rubio who has been absolutely sensational in their series against OKC 
                        even having a triple double in their last game. The Utaz Jazz player fun quality basketball. What I mean 
                        by that is they are really fun to watch play basketball. They share the basketball, defend as a team, and
                        always take the best shot. These are the things that make for me basketball so much fun. However, dont get
                        it twisted when Kyrie isoed on Steph Curry in game 7 of the 2016 finals, hitting that shot I just about
                        died from excitment, and woke up my whole family. Regardless of that, playing quality basketball making
                        watching basketball fun. As the whole league is trending toward iso heavy basketball the Jazz reject this
                        and go to their own rythm. You can see this as the player play, the Jazz seem to love playing this type of
                        basketball. Which was clearly there plan coming into the season, things change though. Sometimes for the 
                        better sometimes not. For the Jazz they went through a bit of a roller coaster. Rudy Gobert the clear learder
                        for DPOY got injuried for 15 plus games. Which when you acutally examine the Jazz with and without Rudy 
                        his affect is massive. While just averaging a 13 points, he has a massive impact on how the opposing team 
                        can attack the basket. Gobert roams the paint and
